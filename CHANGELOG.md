## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.2] - 2022-01-04
### Fixed
- Will this fix `mindsers/changelog-reader-action@v2`?

## [0.6.1] - 2022-01-04
### Fixed
- Fix stupid pypi classifier strictness

## [0.6.0] - 2022-01-04
### Changed
- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** registers have been widely renamed for consistency and clarity. The joys of a pre-release API.
- Checked all the registers and their values to make sense. Added units for most that are self-evident. The
  `Inverter` object is shaping up nicely as a user-friendly representation of the inverter dataset â€“ TODO is
  likely splitting out a `Battery` representation too, to account for systems with multiple battery units (and
  those without batteries at all!). The same might make sense for the PV aspect as well.

### Fixed
- Avoid loading a whole batch of input registers that seem completely unused and save a network call.
- Match prod release workflow to preview to use py3.9
- Update PyPI classifiers to specify Alpha quality :)
